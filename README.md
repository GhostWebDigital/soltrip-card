##  Problem & Solution
### Problem
400M+ crypto users can trade and hold assets, but **cannot easily spend them** in the real world.  
Existing cards are centralized, slow, and rely on heavy KYC and high fees. Slow off-ramps, and centralized custody are still the norm.

### Solution
- **Top-up in USDC/USDT** on Solana Mainnet  
- **Instant virtual card** generation (Mastercard-compatible)  
- **Soft KYC** onboarding in under 60 seconds  
- **Non-custodial** and globally accessible

##  Business Model
- **Card issuing fee** on each activation  
- **Transaction margin** from FX & merchant fees  
- **Top-up fees** for deposits in stablecoins  
- **Premium plan** for higher limits & perks  

> **Your crypto. Your spending. Your freedom.**

##  Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Solana Mainnet**
- **Squads Grid API** for card issuing
- **USDC / USDT integration**
- **Non-custodial wallet layer** (planned)
- **Web frontend (Next.js / React)**
